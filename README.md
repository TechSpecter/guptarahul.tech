# [My Personal Website](https://guptarahul.tech) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg" alt="Version">

This is my personal website and heavily inspired from [this](https://jofftiquez.dev/). It is built with Vue.js & Nuxt.js and hosted on Vercel. <br> <br>
**Feel free to copy, modify, or comment. Made with <3 by [Rahul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gupta-r/) If there is any suggestion, please reach out to me by [email](mailto:rahul4sap@gmail.com).**

## Features

- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** and **[Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/)**: Leverage the power of Vue.js and Nuxt.js for efficient and scalable web development.

- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** **and** **[DaisyUI](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui)**: Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. DaisyUI is a customizable Tailwind CSS component library that prevents verbose markup in frontend applications.

## Build Setup

You will need a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with access to the command-line and permission to install new system packages. An active internet connection is required in order to install the following required software:

- Node (version 18 or higher) https://nodejs.org/en/ 
- NPM https://www.npmjs.com/
- Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/
- Vue CLI https://cli.vuejs.org/

Using the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the unzipped theme and run the `npm install` command. This will install all of the required packages and prepare your project for local development and production deployment. Once complete, type `npm run dev` and press the <kbd>enter</kbd> key. Vue CLI will then compile the project and serve a local server located at http://localhost:8080.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn run start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

# Browser Support

At present, we officially aim to support the last two versions of the following browsers:
